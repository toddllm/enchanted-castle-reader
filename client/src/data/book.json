          "content": "THERE were three of them--Jerry, Jimmy, and Kathleen. Of course, Jerry's\nname was Gerald, and not Jeremiah, whatever you may think; and Jimmy's\nname was James; and Kathleen was never called by her name at all, but\nCathy, or Catty, or Puss Cat, when her brothers were pleased with her,\nand Scratch Cat when they were not pleased. And they were at school in a\nlittle town in the West of England--the boys at one school, of course,\nand the girl at another, because the sensible habit of having boys and\ngirls at the same school is not yet as common as I hope it will be some\nday. They used to see each other on Saturdays and Sundays at the house\nof a kind maiden lady; but it was one of those houses where it is\nimpossible to play. You know the kind of house, don't you? There is a\nsort of a something about that kind of house that makes you hardly able\neven to talk to each other when you are left alone, and playing seems\nunnatural and affected. So they looked forward to the holidays, when\nthey should all go home and be together all day long, in a house where\nplaying was natural and conversation possible, and where the Hampshire\nforests and fields were full of interesting things to do and see. Their\nCousin Betty was to be there too, and there were plans. Betty's school\nbroke up before theirs, and so she got to the Hampshire home first, and\nthe moment she got there she began to have measles, so that my three\ncouldn't go home at all. You may imagine their feelings. The thought of\nseven weeks at Miss Hervey's was not to be borne, and all three wrote\nhome and said so. This astonished their parents very much, because they\nhad always thought it was so nice for the children to have dear Miss\nHervey's to go to. However, they were \"jolly decent about it,\" as Jerry\nsaid, and after a lot of letters and telegrams, it was arranged that the\nboys should go and stay at Kathleen's school, where there were now no\ngirls left and no mistresses except the French one.",

We do\nhave tablecloths on the tables and curtains at the windows, and yours is\nall deal boards, and desks, and inkiness.\"\n\nWhen they had gone to pack their boxes Kathleen made all the rooms as\npretty as she could with flowers in jam jars, marigolds chiefly,\nbecause there was nothing much else in the back garden. There were\ngeraniums in the front garden, and calceolarias and lobelias; of course,\nthe children were not allowed to pick these.",
